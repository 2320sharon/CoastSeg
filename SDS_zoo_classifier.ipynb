    "\n",
    "**How it  Works**: Select the model you want to use, then select settings that will be used to run your model and then click either **Select Data Directory** or **Select Images**  to load satellite imagery for the model to run on."

    "   - Reduces vegetation effects better than NDWI and is more suitable for enhancing and extracting water information in regions with a background dominated by built-up land areas.\n",

    "## How to Run Image Segmentation Models on the Downloaded Imagery\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select Imagery Type**: Choose the type of imagery you have: **RGB**, **NDWI**, or **MNDWI**.\n",
    "   - If you select **NDWI** or **MNDWI**, the **RGB** directory will automatically be converted to the selected type and saved to a new folder named after the selected type. For example, if you choose **NDWI**, a new directory called **NDWI** will appear next to the **RGB** directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose a Model**: Select the image segmentation model you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select Performance Mode**: Choose between **Ensemble** or **Best** (Best is recommended for faster performance).\n",
    "   - **Best**: Uses only the best model available on the images. This option is faster since it involves a single model making the prediction.\n",
    "   - **Ensemble**: Utilizes all available models to create more accurate predictions. Although it takes longer to make a single prediction, the resulting segmentation is generally more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Select Imagery Directory**: Choose the directory of imagery to run the model on.\n",
    "   - Select an ROI (Region of Interest) directory under the `data` directory.\n",
    "   - Always select a directory named 'RGB'.\n",
