# Seg2Map
The mapping extension for Zoo; carry out image segmentation on geospatial datasets

This tool will facilitate Doodler and Zoo style image segmentation on geospatial imagery, by combining the following elements

### Cloud-based image retrieval
- [ ] coastsat for image retrieval
- [ ] also [wxee](https://github.com/aazuspan/wxee) for image retrieval and xarray support

### Parallelism and modern geospatial formats
- [ ] xarrays facilitate segmentation workflows in Dask
- [ ] COGs

### A local ipyleaflet tile server for data 
- [ ] [Local Tile Server for Geospatial Rasters](https://github.com/banesullivan/localtileserver?s=09#ipyleaflet-tile-layers)
- [ ] all ipyleaflet and folium functionality for data exploration and retrieval

### Doodler for geospatial imagery
- [ ] interface imagery for doodler
- [ ] wrapper utilities to convert labels to geospatial formats

### Zoo for geospatial imagery
- [ ] interface for preparing datasets for Zoo model training and evaluation
- [ ] interface for applying trained models to geospatial imagery
