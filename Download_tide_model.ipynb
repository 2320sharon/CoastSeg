    "### Step 1: Registration\n",
    "- **Sign Up:** Begin by registering on the AVISO platform. Visit the [AVISO Registration Page ](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/registration-form.html) to create your account.\n",
    "### Step 2: Select the FES 2014 Model\n",
    "- **Model Selection:** During the registration process, you'll be presented with various data models to choose from. Ensure you select the **FES2014 / FES2012 (Oceanic Tides Heights)** model.\n",

    "## ⚠️ Prerequisites\n",
    "Before proceeding with the download, please ensure the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage:** Ensure you have at least 14GB of free space on your computer. The FES2014 model is extensive.\n",

    "### Requirements:\n",
    "1. **AVISO Credentials:**\n",
    "- Your AVISO username\n",
    "- Your AVISO password\n",
    "2. **Storage:** A minimum of 14.6 GB of free space on your computer.\n",
    "## Step 2: Download the Tide Model\n",
    "Enter your credentials and click Go\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting:\n",
    "If you encounter issues during the download:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Account Verification:** Ensure your AVISO account is verified. An unverified account will restrict model downloads.\n",
    "2. **Server Downtime:** The AVISO server might occasionally experience downtimes. If you suspect this is the case, wait for a few hours and attempt the download again."
