    "# Extract Shorelines From Downloaded Imagery\n",
    "------\n",
    "Extracted Shorelines are shoreline vectors in the imagery you downloaded from GEE. The extracted shorelines are created by analyzing each `.tiff` file for each set of satellite imagery downloaded to check if a shoreline classifier can be applied to it. If the `.tiff` file meets the quality standards by being under the maxiumum theshold for cloud cover and other metrics the image is analyzed by a special image segmentation model which classifies the sand, water and surf in the image. Using the labeled images from the image segmentation model a shoreline vector will be detected in the image and saved to a dictionary entry for the ROI it belonged to. The extracted shoreline will appear in purple on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Beta Shorelines Do Not Always Work Properly\n",
    "The classifier to extract shorelines is still under development and fails for complex shorelines sometimes. If you see extracted shorelines that zig and zag this is likely the result of the classifier failing to classifiy your image. You may want to try changing the sand color parameter of the classifier if the sand on your coast is dark or light.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Bugs Under Development\n",
    "1. Multiple shoreline vectors will be rendered onto the map at the same location because all the shorelines accross the time period you selected are calculated at the same time. In the next release of CoastSeg these will be rendered one at a time on the map and you will be able to select which dates are rendered.\n",
    "2. Sometimes shorelines will be not be able to be extracted from any of the imagery downloaded for the ROI on the map due to image quality issues such as excessive cloud cover or too many 'no data'(black) pixels in the downloaded imagery. When this is the case the extracted shoreline will not appear on the map. In a future update of coastseg there will be error messages to tell you when this has occured.\n",
